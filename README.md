# About this story

**[America’s schools are more diverse than ever. But the teachers are still mostly white.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/local/education/teacher-diversity/)**

Minority students, particularly Latinos, are on the rise, but few of their classes are taught by teachers of the same race.

# Source data

For 44 states and the District of Columbia, teacher data was obtained from each state’s Department of Education. Teacher data for Arizona and Virginia was obtained from school districts. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Utah were unable to provide reliable data, or any data at all. The collected teacher data covers districts that serve 94 percent of American students. 

Student data relies on the [Common Core of Data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ccddata.asp) from the National Center for Education Statistics. 


Additional details for this analysis can be found in the [About this story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/local/education/teacher-diversity/) section of the story.
